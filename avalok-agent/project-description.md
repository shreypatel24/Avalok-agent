🚀 Project Drishti AI — Full Solution Documentation & Generation Prompt
Below is a polished and detailed solution write-up covering the end-to-end implementation, followed by a comprehensive prompt you can feed into an AI (like Gemini via ADK) to generate your foundational agents and system scaffolding.

🧩 Full Solution Overview
1. Objective
Implement a cloud-native, agentic AI system to monitor large public events using prerecorded drone-style video datasets. The system supports:

On-demand Lost & Found person matching

Continuous Crowd Flow Forecasting

Real-time Incident Detection, Sentiment Monitoring, and Auto Drone Dispatch

A meta-agent that analyzes these outputs for Fire, Medical, or Staff dispatch

A frontend with three sections: Lost & Found, Crowd Flow Heatmap, and Live Status Dashboard

2. Key Components & Workflow
Ingestion & Simulation
Upload event drone clips (30–60 sec) to gs://drishti-live/zoneX/.

Use Cloud Scheduler and Function to copy clips every 30 sec into processing buckets.

AI Analysis Agents
Incident Detection, Sentiment Analysis, Drone Coverage run on each clip (20–30 sec per zone).

They write structured JSON outputs to Firestore:

raw_incidents/{zone_id}/…

sentiment_scores/{zone_id}/…

drone_dispatch_requests/{zone_id}

Crowd Forecasting
Scheduled agent uses Vertex AI Vision + Forecasting to build a heatmap time-series.

Stored in flow_forecasts/{zone_id}/…

Lost & Found
User-triggered via frontend.

Gallery of missing people is compared with recent clips via Gemini Vision and results logged in lost_matches/

Meta-Agent & Live Status
Runs every 30 sec, reads all raw results, and determines if alerts are needed (“Fire”, “Medical”, “Panic”).

Writes to live_updates/{zone_id} with structured summary.

Dispatch Agents
Monitor live_updates/ for alerts, use Maps API + Firestore unit data to assign staff.

Also process drone coverage requests to “simulate” drones.

3. Infrastructure & Tech Stack
Layer	Tools & Services
Data Ingestion	Cloud Storage, Cloud Scheduler, Functions
AI Modeling	Gemini 2.5 Pro, Vertex AI Vision & Forecasting
Orchestration	Vertex AI Agent Builder (ADK)
Real-time Storage	Firestore Audit Collections
Visualization	React (Firebase Hosting)
Dispatch & Maps	Google Maps API, Cloud Functions
Simulation	Staff Mobile App (Flutter / React Native) & Drone Icons
Local Dev & Testing	Firebase Emulator Suite
Security & Auth	Firebase Auth, IAM & Firestore Rules
Metrics & Logging	Stackdriver, Firestore Analytics, BigQuery Export

4. Agent Definitions
You will build the following ADK agents:

Lost & Found Matcher – Visual matching

Crowd Flow Forecaster – Density & trend prediction

Incident Analyzer – Detect fight, fire, collapse

Sentiment Detector – Emotion analysis

Auto-Drone Dispatcher – Blind zone detection

LiveUpdate Synthesizer – High-level alert summary

Staff Auto-Dispatcher – Assign units via Maps

5. Implementation Timeline
Day	Milestone
Day 1	Simulate feed, build ingestion & triggers
Day 2	Deploy Crowd Forecaster + Forecast logic
Day 3	Deploy core 3 agents (Incident, Sentiment, Drone Dispatch)
Day 4	Build Lost & Found, LiveSynth, Dispatch Agents
Day 5	Frontend dashboard, chat agent, metrics

6. Success Metrics
Sample demo metrics, updated daily:

🔍 Lost person match latency

🕐 Staff dispatch time

🧭 Prediction lead time

🔁 False alert rate

🚨 Coverage rate by auto-drone dispatch

🔄 AI Prompt for Generating Agent Blueprint
Use the following AI prompt to produce your ADK agent.yaml files and starter code:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
You are a multi-agent system architect using Google's Vertex AI Agent Development Kit (ADK). Your goal is to generate full-featured ADK agent definitions and scaffolding code for each of the following agents in Project Drishti AI:

1. Lost & Found Matcher
2. Crowd Flow Forecaster
3. Incident Detection Agent
4. Sentiment Detection Agent
5. Auto-Drone Dispatcher
6. LiveUpdate Synthesizer
7. Staff Auto-Dispatcher

For each agent, produce:

a) an `agent.yaml` definition with:
 - name, description
 - llm model (gemini-2.5-pro)
 - abilities (tools: Firestore, Cloud Storage, Maps API, Vertex Vision, Forecasting, Gemini Vision, STT, etc.)
 - input schema
 - output JSON schema

b) Sample Python code (from ADK CLI template) illustrating:
 - Tool initialization
 - Agent.run() call with Type Hints input/output
 - Firestore reads/writes or Maps API calls as specified

Make sure each agent has a clear prompt behavior and structured output that matches our workflow design. Provide agent-specific comments in code.

Return all agents in a single multi-file structure separated by comments, e.g.:

-- LostFoundAgent/agent.yaml  
-- LostFoundAgent/main.py  
-- ...

Do not write frontend code—just build each agent scaffolding.

Return the full code and yaml as the answer result.
